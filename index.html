<h2><a id="communicate"></a>Project Introduction</h2>
<p>To start off with, if I had to sum up the goals of D3Up.com into a sentence, it would be as follows:</p>
<blockquote>D3Up.com is a tool to help players learn about Diablo 3 characters, the game mechanics behind them, and determine ways to push their character to the limit.</blockquote>
<br/>
<p>I've been working on D3Up.com solo since June of 2012 and decided to make this a much more community project. Up until this point, I've never released any codebase this large on github or as an open source project. Please bear with me and feel free to make suggestions on how things should or shouldn't be done (in a constructive way).</p>
<p>I still have an overall vision for the site and plan on steering towards it, focusing on being a learning tool first and everything else second. To start I plan on being the only person accepting pull requests, which will most likely change over time if people contribute.</p>
<p>Please don't get offended if I ask you to change something in your pull request. Feel free to try to convince me otherwise, but if I have a good reason, I'm not just going to cave. For example, if you try to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Add a forum to the site, I'll say no. Remember, learning game mechanics, exploring stats, theorycrafting, not complaining about how OP barbarians are.</li>
	<li>Provide a logo, design or graphic I don't like, I'll say no. While my design skills may not be top notch, I do have an opinion on design matters.</li>
	<li>Write code that's poorly optimized / implemented, I'll probably say no. Mind you, if I commit some crappy code, call me out on it or comment what could be done better, I'll listen. I plan on doing the same, providing constructive feedback.</li>
	<li>Commit stuff that breaks unit tests, I'll complain probably. Please test stuff, don't break things! If I break things, by all means, complain.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd also like to say that some of you are going to cringe at code you find, as I'm going to cringe right back at some of the code submitted in your pull requests. Parts of the code were written almost a year ago and in a rush, in what extra free time I had. Other parts of the code were somewhat of a learning experiences for me that never got revisited and improved upon, which lead me to... The Calculator. It's a monster and has been hacked apart so much I barely recognize it. So, I apologize when your head explodes inside `/public/js`. It works however, and as you'll see below, I'm not planning on focusing on it for the 2.0 release.</p>
<p>I think I've put enough disclaimers, so to wrap up the introduction, here's my plan for Version 2:</p>
<ol>
	<li>(v2.0) Build the PHP/Laravel/MongoDB Backend using Handlebars to serve out V1 Calculator values</li>
	<li>(v2.1) Rewrite the Calculator and Game Data tools to fit the new Backend/Handlebars</li>
	<li>(v2.2) TBD - Wherever the community leads</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm hoping that v2.0 will be ready this summer, and maybe aim for 2.1 this fall/winter.</p>
<p>Thanks for your interest in the project and feel free to contact me.</p>
<h2><a id="communicate"></a>Ways to Communicate</h2>
<p>I've setup numerous ways for anyone wishing to participate to join in the development discussion. Listed below are the three primary methods of communication I use.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Github Issues</strong> - Please use the <a href="https://github.com/aaroncox/D3Up.com/issues">Github Issues</a> section of the project for any bugs or features you'd like to request, talk about or get help with.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reddit</strong> - For anything else, or if you just are a bigger reddit fan, feel free to post anything D3Up related on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/d3up">/r/d3up</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>IRC</strong> - If you're IRC savvy, feel free to join the chat on <code>irc.esper.net</code> in the channel <code>#d3up</code>. Github notifications and Jenkins both notify the #d3up channel of any activity on the master branch of the project.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a id="components"></a>Frameworks, Languages, and Components</h2>

<p>Server Languages/Components:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://php.net">PHP 5.4</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mongodb.org">MongoDB 2.0+</a></li>
<li>A web server that supports URL rewrites, nginx, apache, etc</li>
</ul><p>D3Up uses the following frameworks/bundles:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://laravel.com">Laravel v3</a> - PHP Framework

<ul>
<li>MyUnit (Bundle) - PHPUnit Wrapper for Laravel</li>
<li>Binder (Bundle) - HTML Helpers</li>
<li>S3 (Bundle) - Allows communication with Amazon S3</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://github.com/aaroncox/epicmongo">EpicMongo</a> - PHP/MongoDB ORM</li>
<li>
<a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> - Javascript Engine</li>
<li>
<a href="http://underscorejs.org">underscore</a> - Javascript Framework (the Calculators use)</li>
<li>
<a href="http://handlebarsjs.com">HandleBars</a> - Javascript Templating Engine</li>
<li>
<a href="twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html">Bootstrap</a> - CSS Framework / Utilities</li>
</ul><p><strong>EditorConfig</strong> - D3Up uses <a href="http://editorconfig.org">EditorConfig</a> to ensure everyones tabs and spaces are properly aligned. Please make sure you're using an Editor/IDE that supports EditorConfig and please enable it!</p>

<h2>
<a id="environment"></a>Setting up your Environement</h2>

<p>If you're wanting to setup a local instance of D3Up, here's a few things you'll need to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fork the repository so you have your own copy to work on and submit pull requests from.</li>
<li>Clone the Repository to your machine and setup your web server to handle requests to it.</li>
<li>Please make sure to use `local.d3up.com` as the vhost/dns name for your version, it will force the application to use the development environment. If you need to use something else, please add the hostname to <a href="https://github.com/aaroncox/D3Up.com/blob/master/paths.php#L25">paths.php</a> under 'development'.</li>
<li>Copy <code>application/config/application.template</code> to <code>application/config/application.php</code> and change the <code>key</code> in the file to a unique value.</li>
<li>Make sure to run <code>git submodule update --init</code> to pull in a copy of the libraries/bundles it uses.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a id="unittests"></a>Passing the Unit Tests</h2>

<p>My goal here is to ensure all tests (located in the <code>application/tests</code> folder) pass after any changes are made..</p>

<p>Currently, there is no javascript testing framework. The javascript is still a monstrosity from Version 1, and I'd honestly like to rewrite it with some guidance from the JS community.</p>

<p>Laravel makes testing easy, you can run the tests by executing the following command from the command line (in the D3Up.com folder):</p>

<p><code>php artisan myunit</code></p>

<p>This requires that PHPUnit is installed on your system, just google for <code>phpunit install [insert your OS here]</code> to find out how.</p>

<p>I also have Jenkins running to notify the #d3up IRC channel whenever changes are applies to the master branch and whether or not they pass the unit tests. You can view all of the results on <a href="http://jenkins.greymass.com">jenkins.greymass.com</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="pullrequests"></a>Submitting Changes</h2>

<p>All changes submitted must be in the form of a <em>Pull Request</em>, which will then be reviewed by the community and once accepted, will be merged into the live codebase and deployed to D3Up.com.</p>

<p>I'd recommend reading <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">Using Pull Requests</a> on github:help or doing some searches for more information. I don't want to clutter up this documentation too much with how pull requests work.</p>
